Props
1. Props is an object and can be passed to component and its children
2. Props is read only if you need an updatable variable use state

State
1. If state is changed for any reason, render is called immediately
2. If render does not use any value of variables, don't use them as state, declare and defice anything but not on state
3. State value can't be set in constructor without calling super(props)
4. Direct setStage method is no good on many scenario where prevState value is required to access, it could be asynchronous and expected value may not
retrieved so use arrow function passing prevState and props
5. States are local to class or function used on making component

Class
1. Class method in javascript are not bound automatically for 'this' varibles to work properly it has to be bound

Component Lifecycle
1. componentDidMount will be execute just after render is executed
2. One component can make a use of other componets and its children

JSX
1. Any plain function or constants or class extending react compentn can use used as react componet which should return or render jsx which is JS extension
looks similar to string literal or template engines but more power than these because of power of JS in jsx
2. JSX prevents injection attack so its safe for use user input
